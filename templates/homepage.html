      This is a test project, so all users created to test the application will
      be removed from the database after 24 hours from its creation. This is an
      automatic process. Thanks for understanding

      This is a test project, designed in Django, and created to show certain
      skills as a backend developer; It is an artificial intelligence chat,
      connected to the external OpenAI API that manages to generate the chat
      experience with said technology, it has a Postgres database to save users
      and their conversation histories, that is, it saves all the messages that
      you send, I have also incorporated Celery to execute the asynchronous task
      of eliminating users that exceed 24 hours of creation and that relies on
      Redis as a message broker. In addition, all these services are executed
      and orchestrated within Docker and Docker-compose. The code for the entire
      project is on my GitHub page.
